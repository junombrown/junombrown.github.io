                <p>This is Milo, my fish. <br> In October Milo considered how its aquarium (my website's homepage) looked a little like a window display, 
                    and thought it conceptually interesting to make use of this idea. I thought this was a brilliant idea and was very proud
                    of my Milo fish. <br>
                    So, now and then Milo and I (democratically) pick something (made by someone else) which we both like
                    and display it in the aquarium.</p>

                            <br><br> Tube Lights is a collection of lamps made from broken, discarded fluorescent tube lights (TLâ€™s). The Tube Light series emerged out of questions surrounding the themes of value and efficiency.
                        <br><br>The collection of lamps makes use of and highlights the material qualities of the broken TL, an object that has lost its function. Purely functional objects, 
                        like these light bulbs, have their value directly connected to their practical capabilities. 
                        So, if a TL breaks, it loses not only its function but also its value.
                        <br><br>
                        By recontextualising these TLâ€™s (in combination with other materials) into a unique object, they acquire a new value. 
                        Now bringing focus to the intriguing aesthetical qualities of the TL, like it's material and form.

                    <h2>FACTORY OF INEFFICIENCY</h2> <br>
                    <p>
                        2021 <br> <br> <em>Presented at Dutch Design Week 2022:</em>
                        <br> <a class="bio_links" href="https://ddw.nl/en/programme/8224/graduation-show-2022" target="_blank">Graduation Show 2022</a> <br><br>
                        To demonstrate that there is value in inefficiency, I built a tiny match factory, in which I act as the only employee. 
                        <br><br>With this, I revisit the once flourishing match industry in Eindhoven, which coined it the 
                        <em>light city</em> (<em>lichtstad</em>) well before the Philips light bulb era. 
                        <br><em>Factory of Inefficiency</em> subtly defies the current industrial focus on growth and efficacy.
                        <br><br> It considers the merit of other values, like the pleasure of work, an appreciation for the imperfect, 
                        or the excitement of stumbling across the unexpected. 
                        <br><br>
                        During Dutch Design Week 2022, the factory stood on the first floor of the old KPN telecom building.
                        Here, visitors were free to come in and explore the interior of the factory. I, as employee, was of course often there; inefficiently at work.
                        A lot of interesting conversations took place that week, with people sharing their opinions and experiences with inefficiency (and matches).
                        <br>In those moments the factory found its true form and purpose.

                        <br><br>I joined the metal art department. Between pine forests, hills, lakes, folkÃ¶l and saunas lies their huge, industrial workshop. Here I was free to roam, explore and experiment.

                    <h2>NOMADIC PLATFORM // BEACH CHAIR BONANZA</h2> <br>
                    <p>
                        2021 <br> <br>Reacting to the privatisation of public space, I built a bike trailer that could fold out into a platform. This platform can be cycled to any public area, fold out, and act as a tool for claiming the surrounding space. <br>A platform
                        for creativity: a stage, a table, a workbench. <br><br>Inspired by the 90s party-protests of Reclaim the Streets. Claiming space by being and doing. <br><br>The first event was Beach Chair Bonanza - a beach chair building workshop.
                        Making chairs in public space with people. Together constructing these symbols of comfort a relaxation, then setting them out. Sitting together. Using that which belongs to the people of the city. <br>
